**funwithmouse** is a dos app where you can use left or right mouse button to draw, just for fun.
The point is to demonstrate the use of mouse in *DOS* using mouse interrupt `33h` from assembly language.
The assembly language function can itself be called by compiling the assembly language program as a
binary file and using `call absoulute` in *QuickBASIC*, or by compiling the program as a library that
can converted to a *Quick library (QLB)* and declaring the subroutines and functions.
