#qb-fun-with-mouse

**qb-fun-with-mouse** is a dos app where you can use left or right mouse button to draw, just for fun.
The point is to demonstrate the use of mouse in DOS using mouse interrupt 33h from assembly language.
The assembly language function can itself be called by compiling the assembly language program as a
binary file ans using call absoulute in QuickBASIC, or by compiling the program as a library that
can converted to a Quick library (QLB) and declaring the methods.
