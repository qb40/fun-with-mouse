**funwithmouse** is a dos app where you can use left or right mouse button to
draw, just for fun. The point is to demonstrate the use of mouse in *DOS* using
mouse interrupt `33h` from assembly language. The assembly language function can
itself be called by compiling the assembly language program as a binary file and
using `CALL ABSOLUTE` in *QuickBASIC*, or by compiling the program as a library
that can converted to a *Quick library (QLB)* and declaring the subroutines and
functions.
